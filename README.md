# Energy Consumption in the UK Dashboard

## Introduction

[Energy Consumption in the UK (ECUK)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-consumption-in-the-uk) is an annual publication from the UK's [Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy)

The statistics presented in this dashboard are sector energy consumption by fuel and intensity. Intensity is a measure of energy consumption per unit of output.

The tool allows users to explore trends in energy consumption and intensity since 2000 and to download filtered datasets for their own use.

## Consumption by fuel

There are two tabs in which the data is filtered, the "By Fuel" and "By Sector". The datasets are filtered independently on each tab and the controls in the side panel are different on each of the two tabs.

In the "By Fuel" tab there is a drop down which allows users to filter by sector. There is also a drop down for year for the "Consumption Share" chart and the "Year on Year Change" chart. The checkboxes are used to create a list of fuels which also filters the dataset.

The pie chart shows consumption by fuel as a proportion of all consumption in the sectors selected and for the fuels selected. Absolute values are in kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe).

## Consumption by sector

In the "By Fuel" tab there is a drop down which allows users to filter by fuel. There is also a drop down for year for the "Consumption Share" chart and the "Year on Year Change" chart. The checkboxes are used to create a list of sectors which also filters the dataset.

The pie chart shows consumption by sector as a proportion of all consumption for the fuels selected and for the sectors selected. Absolute values are in kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe).

## Data download

The data download with produce a .csv of the time series used to produce the plot in the time series panel though it will not account for filters applied within the Plotly visualisation itself through the interactive legend.

## Colour schemes

The colour schemes were inherited from the 2019 version of the ECUK dashboard and are consistent with the spreadsheet publications of ECUK.
